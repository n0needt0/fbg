###Preface
Our medical office is required to store multitudes of patient files. The files consist of various medical notes, correspondences and financial statements. The documents are stored in folders, and are tabbed by patient name. Patient names may collide, therefore a combination of the patient's name and the last 4 digits of his or her SSN number are used. 
Archiving new correspondence is a semi-weekly process of sorting and filing new documents  into corresponding folders.  Files are used by checking them out in a ledger.
Files do not get purged from old documents and grow indefinitely.

###Problems
1. Files are stored on premises in 400 SQF cost of $30 per 1 SQF per  year, or $12,000
2. Files are NOT backed up for off-site storage, an additional expense of X$
3. Because of no back up, files are at constant risk of loss
4. Files are stored without encryption and without access control or access logs
5. Sending files require faxing or copying, even for inter-clinic requests 
6. While files are removed from file room,  their updates are blocked.
7. Paper-based data can not be analysed or searched
8. Other department namely Finance and HR also produce similar files.
