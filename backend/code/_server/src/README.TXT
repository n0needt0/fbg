wtf is IT DID NOT HAPPENED alerter 
wtf will notify you in preset interval unless you reset timer first.

for example, you only want to know if some cron job DID not run or
if you did not check in with your interface (i.e. forgot or missed something)

wtf will send you email, sms or pull a predefined URL

COMPILE it first $go build cronrat-server.go
